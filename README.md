# Fun-Project---Snake-Water-Gun-Game
This is a lighthearted and entertaining Python game inspired by the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" concept
In this game, the player competes against the computer, choosing between Snake, Water, or Gun. The rules are simple:

Snake drinks Water 🐍💧 → Snake wins
Water drowns Gun 💧🔫 → Water wins
Gun kills Snake 🔫🐍 → Gun wins

The computer’s choice is generated randomly, making every round unpredictable and exciting. Players can enjoy multiple rounds and keep track of their score while having some fun. This project is perfect as a quick coding exercise, a boredom buster, or a playful mini-game to show friends.
